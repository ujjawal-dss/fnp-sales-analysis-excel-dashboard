# fnp-sales-analysis-excel-dashboard

This project is an Excel-based sales analysis of the Ferns & Petals (FNP) dataset.
I created an interactive dashboard using PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and automated KPIs to understand sales trends, top products, customer spending, delivery times, and city-wise performance.

The dashboard helps answer real business questions like:

Which months and occasions generate the most revenue?

What are the top-selling products?

Which cities place the highest orders?

How do delivery times vary with order quantity?

The goal was to turn raw data into clear, visual insights that can support better marketing, planning, and decision-making.
